       Issue summary
Duration: April 12, 2024, 10:00 AM - April 12, 2024, 12:00 PM (GMT)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, affecting 80% of users attempting to log in during the outage period.
        Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load              balancer settings, which led to an overload on the authentication service servers.
       Timeline:
10:00 AM: Issue detected through a surge in error logs on the authentication service servers.
10:05 AM: Engineering team alerted via monitoring system.
10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on database connectivity issues due to recent updates.
10:30 AM: Database connectivity confirmed to be stable, attention shifted to load balancer configuration.
11:00 AM: Misconfigured load balancer settings identified as the root cause.
11:30 AM: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for resolution.
12:00 PM: Load balancer settings adjusted, restoring authentication service functionality.
    Root Cause and Resolution:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, overwhelming the authentication service servers. The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to evenly distribute traffic among the servers, ensuring optimal performance.
   Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar outages in the future:
Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to detect misconfigurations early.
Develop and implement a comprehensive testing procedure for load balancer changes before deployment.
Conduct regular audits of critical system configurations to identify and rectify potential issues proactively.
Establish clear communication channels and escalation procedures to facilitate swift resolution of incidents.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to provide real-time visibility into system health and performance metrics.
